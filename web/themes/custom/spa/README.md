# SPA Theme

Drupal theme responsible to serve the React application.

## What do we have here

We try not to be much opinionated on the React toolset to use. Therefore, the default app is as simple as any hello world application can be. There are, though, a couple of decisions we made beforehand:

1. We use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for styles.
1. We use [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for bundling.
1. We use [Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/) for component showcase.
1. We use [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit tests.
1. We use [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) for e2e tests (with Selenium).
